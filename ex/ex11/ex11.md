# Task 11.2. The Cost of Synchronization
ArrayList is 1.43 times faster than Vector
The performance difference stems from synchronization. Vector is thread-safe and incurs the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks for every method call, which consumes resources even in a single-threaded environment. ArrayList is not synchronized, so it completely avoids this locking cost, allowing for significantly faster execution.
