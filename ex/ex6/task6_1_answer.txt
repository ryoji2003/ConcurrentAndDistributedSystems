Task 6.1: Collective Optimization - Answer

Question: Which solution would be more efficient - Bcast() or P-1 Send() calls? Why?

Answer:
Bcast() is more efficient than P-1 Send() calls.

Reason:
When using P-1 Send() calls from the root process, messages are sent sequentially:
- Root sends to process 1, then to process 2, ..., then to process P-1
- Time complexity: O(P) - linear
- All messages originate from a single source (bottleneck)

Bcast() implementations typically use a tree-based algorithm (e.g., binomial tree):
- Step 1: Root sends to 1 process (1 message)
- Step 2: Root and receiver each send to 1 new process (2 messages in parallel)
- Step 3: 4 processes each send to 1 new process (4 messages in parallel)
- ...continues until all processes have the data
- Time complexity: O(log P) - logarithmic

Example with P=8 processes:
- Sequential Send(): 7 steps (messages sent one after another)
- Bcast() with binomial tree: 3 steps (log2(8) = 3)
  - Step 1: 0 -> 1
  - Step 2: 0 -> 2, 1 -> 3 (parallel)
  - Step 3: 0 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 7 (parallel)

Additional benefits of Bcast():
1. Better bandwidth utilization - multiple processes send simultaneously
2. Reduced congestion at root node
3. Network topology awareness - MPI implementations can optimize for hardware
4. Load balancing - communication work is distributed across processes
