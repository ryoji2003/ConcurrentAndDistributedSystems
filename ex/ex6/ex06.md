# Task 6.1. Collective Optimization
Bcast() is significantly more efficient than linear Send() calls, especially as the number of processes ($P$) increases.Linear Send ($O(P)$): If the root process uses a loop to Send() data to $P-1$ processes sequentially, the root becomes a bottleneck. The time required scales linearly with $P$ because the root must serialize the data onto the network link $P-1$ times.Broadcast ($O(\log P)$): MPI libraries (like MPJ Express) typically implement Bcast() using a tree-structured algorithm (e.g., a binomial tree or a binary tree).In the first step, Root sends to Process 1.In the next step, Root sends to Process 2 while Process 1 sends to Process 3 simultaneously.This doubles the number of processes with the data at each step.The time complexity is logarithmic ($O(\log P)$), leading to much lower latency and better bandwidth utilization compared to the sequential method1111.
